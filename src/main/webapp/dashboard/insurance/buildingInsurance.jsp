                            <p>Your house isn't just a building it's also your home. So it would be no good if your
                                central heating sprung a leak when you've just redecorated or if a branch came through
                                the window in a storm. So when it comes to protecting your home, buildings insurance is
                                a must-have.</p><br>
                            <h5><i>What is Building Insurance</i> </h5>
                            <p>Buildings insurance is the part of your home insurance that's for your actual property –
                                rather than your belongings. It covers the structure of your house and includes things
                                like windows and doors, walls and the roof, as well as permanent fittings like your
                                built-in bathroom and fitted kitchen. Most mortgage providers will insist that you have
                                Buildings Insurance as part of the terms of the mortgage agreement.</p>
